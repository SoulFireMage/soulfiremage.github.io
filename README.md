## What's Here?

This is a personal space where code meets curiosity. Equal parts technical deep-dives and speculative wanderings, with occasional detours into fiction.

### Technical Explorations

- **Math meets databases** — SQL, proof notation, and why functions-as-data changed everything
- **Abstract mathematics applied loosely** — Homotopy type theory thrown at DNA and proteins to see what unfolds
- **AI architecture ramblings** — KANs, PINs, and the evening walks through research that happen when you bounce between Claude and Gemini
- **Cell2Cell experiments** — Orchestrating narrow AI models with general AI (because why not point Claude at a gene expression model?)
- **Linux adventures** — A Windows developer's first proper dive into Linux, aided considerably by AI

### Fiction & Stories

The **Aktarian Tales** — sentient starship stories that have been rattling around since 2015. Characters who didn't pay rent and refused to leave. Plus other fragments, some embedded from Google Docs, some published properly.

### Tools

- **Political Objectivity Tester** — An AI-powered tool for analyzing social media posts for factuality, bias, and evidence quality - Bring your own key

### Everything Else

Tulpas. Thoughts on AI in writing (enthusiastic user, but not for fiction — I'd lose something). Career resources for UK tech training. Whatever seems interesting at the time.

## About the Author

.NET and SQL Server developer by trade, with a fondness for F# and functional programming. The GitHub profile is sparse because the day job doesn't hit it — true for most working developers, honestly.

Based in the UK. Cycles through enthusiasms intensely and briefly. Currently in a Linux phase that's lasted longer than expected.
