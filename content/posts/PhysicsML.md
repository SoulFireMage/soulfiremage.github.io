# The Intersection of Physics and Machine Learning

This is a placeholder article for a future discussion on Dr Steve Brunton's work on physics informed machine learning. *Originally I had an AI summary here, however I spent a lot of time going through his materials and am choosing to delay the post in order to use writing it as a full refresh and exploration of the topics covered, along with links. Check back soon if this subject interests you.*
