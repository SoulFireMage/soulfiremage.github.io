## **Government-Funded Digital Skills Bootcamps (Coding & Cybersecurity)**

The UK Department for Education‚Äôs **Skills Bootcamps** are short, intensive training courses (typically 12‚Äì16 weeks) that are completely free for learners. They cover in-demand tech skills and guarantee you an interview with an employer at the end of the course.

(There are also Bootcamps in other industries like green tech, construction, etc.) All training is aligned to industry needs and often results in an industry-recognized credential.  
- **Eligibility:** Open to **adults 19+** anywhere in England (employed, unemployed, or self-employed). **No prior qualifications** in the subject are required for most courses, so you can start fresh.

You also get one-to-one mentorship on things like CVs, interview prep, and personal development throughout the Bootcamp.  
- **Outcomes:** You‚Äôll finish with job-ready skills and a guaranteed interview opportunity. Many Bootcamps work directly with hiring employers to place graduates. These courses are intended to lead straight into jobs or apprenticeships ‚Äì not just theory.
