## **Government-Funded Digital Skills Bootcamps (Coding & Cybersecurity)**

The UK Department for Education’s **Skills Bootcamps** are short, intensive training courses (typically 12–16 weeks) that are completely free for learners. They cover in-demand tech skills and guarantee you an interview with an employer at the end of the course.

### **Key Features:**
- **Fields Covered:** Hundreds of courses in *digital* sectors – for example, **cybersecurity**, coding/web development, data analytics, IT support, and more. (There are also Bootcamps in other industries like green tech, construction, etc.) All training is aligned to industry needs and often results in an industry-recognized credential.  
- **Eligibility:** Open to **adults 19+** anywhere in England (employed, unemployed, or self-employed). **No prior qualifications** in the subject are required for most courses, so you can start fresh. You must commit to job searching after the course. If you’ve already completed a Skills Bootcamp this year, you generally can’t do a second one immediately.  
- **Format:** Many Bootcamps are **blended or in-person** – e.g. some providers run classroom sessions in local hubs, while others might be mostly online with live instruction. They are **short-term full-time** or part-time courses (up to 16 weeks) designed to keep you engaged and accountable (daily lessons, group projects, etc.).  
- **Support:** These programs emphasize structure and support. For example, **Generation UK** runs 9–12 week tech Bootcamps that create a *“structured setting to learn in-demand skills”* and also build confidence. Classes are cohort-based (around 25 learners working together on projects), providing peer support and accountability. You also get one-to-one mentorship on things like CVs, interview prep, and personal development throughout the Bootcamp.  
- **Outcomes:** You’ll finish with job-ready skills and a guaranteed interview opportunity. Many Bootcamps work directly with hiring employers to place graduates. These courses are intended to lead straight into jobs or apprenticeships – not just theory.  
- **How to Apply:** Visit the official **Skills Bootcamps portal** to find courses near you and in your field of interest. You can filter by location or “remote.” **Apply ASAP** when you find an open Bootcamp – seats are limited and free courses are competitive.
