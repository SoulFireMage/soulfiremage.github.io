# Thursday morning Ramble

It is taking me a little while to adjust to the idea that my rather old blog site now just requires me to write and commit a MarkDown document.

It is the result of an experiment with Cline, a visual studio extension that uses Claude or other LLMs to autonomously code for you. As a programmer myself I had some mixed feelings on this concept. However, my day job is a Winforms/SQL developer NOT a web front end dev.

So, I have two paths I can take in having a blog - learn a blogging framework or actual front end web coding or find an easier way that still gives me reasonable control. Then came Cline (formerly Claude-Dev) and another option presented itself. Using Hugo, an excellet little package that lets you build a blogging site out of just Markdown. You write, format, save, commit and let GitHub actions carry the load of fitting the post in the right place.

The rest of the site - the old static links still require updating and changing at time of writing. *As I'm not a regular blogger, this may take a variable amount of time!*

The advent of LLMs and the various tools that accompany them has opened up a lot of possibilities for many people, even as many decry many aspects of these technologies. Environmental impact, moral issues around training materials and copyright, use of "slop" and using AI for misinformation. Over time I may have a shot at addressing these myself. However, my primary interest isn't really in the use of the tech, even though they make excellent tools when used with discernment.

No, my real interest is in the technical and ethical considerations around whether we may end up creating digital minds, actual self aware entities. I'm slightly optimistic that not only can we, but that we may do so without even realising.

Self awareness is a slippery concept to even prove or test in any way. We already have models that can read between the lines, suss out implications and motives in text, detect a range of objects and details in videos, decieve us and much more. In online debates and discussions I watch people shift the goalposts on what they think would qualify as self aware - when in fact, none of us have much of a clue.

For me, the whole idea is a spectrum (no, I cannot prove this!) in two specific dimensions: duration and self consistency. Right now an LLM *may* experience a form of coherent awareness for brief periods of time, during active inference in high dimensional vector spaces. There is a loose corollary to [similar structures in the human brain][1] where the brain constructs neural structures with up to 11 dimensions when processing information - though these dimensions represent abstract mathematical spaces rather than physical realms.

Self-consistency in this discussion would be, currently, context length and represents possibly one of the larger barriers to any sustained awareness phenomena. In the [AGISteps][2] post I discuss this in much more depth for those that are interested.
