# Test Update

I haven't posted a new page here for a while, so I'm testing if the action still works. This is a Cline built Hugo site. The idea being that I can just write MarkDown, and it'll let me submit with a single click. The rest is done via github actions. 

Assuming this just works without trouble, a year later, maybe I'll write more.
