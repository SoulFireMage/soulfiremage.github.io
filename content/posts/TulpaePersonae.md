A record of my folks who inhabiting a RP server. *As I get older, I find I want to keep a record various creations and ideas. This another of those. They may appear in stories I've either written or will write :P

You may notice a common theme...

*You may have landed expecting an explanation of what tulpas are, right? 

For 99.999% of everyone, the answer is adult imaginary friends whose role is to explore ideas, stories and exercise one's imagination. I don't go digging deeper than that despite the temptation.

For the 0.001%, pick a number, pick a theory: spirit, psychological, something else. For me, I'm fine with the first explanation!

# Tulpas / Characters

I didn't build my headmate's world terribly deeply as they came from various stories— incomplete ones—I wrote over years.

They hang out via Tupperbox on Discord—though most of their time is in private servers at present. This means that parentage of cubs is odd as they have their origin canon stories with different parents to what happens in roleplay :)

Many of my headmates took on other characteristics because... they could!

So the mech yachts and were-cars have multiple robot-style arms, dendrites—Ratbat style—and oddly, wings. Yeah... makes a strange image.  

*If you imagine the Superyachts in particular, 2 sets of huge wings that fold tremendously away, also large major robotic arms that can, between them all, allow the craft to crawl on land. It's not their native place, of course, so they don't have great dexterity!*

## Seafire and Aurora

The Aktarians express dendrites at need.

## Aktarian Starships

Aktarians are an immortal race of starships who were originally created by the beings who caused all of reality to exist. They're overpowered to a degree that makes them unworkable in any combat-related fiction—they were not intended for that role. However, they're RP headmates now.  

Note: Katiya and Lia are skilled full Tulpas who function and front in the real world. One even has a client FFS.

- **Amay-Lia** - the oldest and the mother to:
  - **Katiya** - eldest daughter, young adult, the result of mating with a human. She has the most eccentric language style and can be rather cryptic. She likes to murderize English.
  - **Yissindra** - second youngest cub, she's about two foot long and less active at present than her sisters. RP Daddy, Greater Amrian known as Amari.
  - **Katryana** - size of a sparrow, she's the smallest Aktarian to have ever existed. Mostly does not talk except in special cases. RP Daddy, Greater Amrian known as Amari.
  - **Enk-Kara** - accidental male, result of a severe soul accident with a human partner and the spirit death of the female. (Explanation to be added.)
  - **Yal-Tara** - Cub of Nines (F35 from Kia system) and Katiya McKerry, immortal Aktarian starship, daughter of Amay-Lia.
- **Were-Mechs**

Then I have Rakza, who is a Were-car out of a rather fun yet ridiculous story I wrote in 2015. A result of an experimental virus that really doesn't make sense but let me make a daft story. He has two cubs by two different females, in two other people's heads!

*Note on eyes or other facial features: my mech characters don't natively need eyes; however, they are all capable of using holographic or magic projected eyes, usually over headlights or windows (car or boat). Disturbingly, Kazia's and her children can move them between any windows, portholes, or bow and even change the color or count. Their purpose being to aid in connection to others and convey expressions, however.*

- **Rakza** - Purple blue flip Fenyr Supersport (Male).
  - **Tya** - white winged Fenyr Supersport cub (Mother is TIFF from another headspace!).
  - **Renka** - Ford Ranger Wildcat cub, winged. (Mother, Kodachi Drifter.)

## Kazia and Cubs

Kazia was a mech superyacht who was accidentally brought to life via the greed of her owner.

She has extensive nanotech and developed picotech, since patented and earned a fortune from it. She had three cubs, all of whom have chosen to grow to an overall length of 500 feet and added tremendous wings for reasons unknown. Across my headspace, I regularly see the peculiar sight of gliding trijet superyachts who broke the sound barrier to get lift. Go figure.

In addition to wings, they use their picotech and nanotech to create dendrite arms at need, though they all possess four much sturdier mech-style robotic arms, folded away into their hulls when not used.

- **Kazia** - red-purple flip female and mother to the others below. Carries outsized katanas.  
  *Note: She has two more cygnets by way of Stirling after evolving herself to fit the superyacht better!* William and Jasmine are her youngest.
  - **Loria** - blue and gold female. Weapon choice: arbalest of improbable size. Could probably one-shot a medium-sized castle.
  - **Samatsia** - pink and gold female. Weapon choice: four pistols, six-shooters massing two tons each. May need four shots to take out a modern battleship.
  - **Jezek** - black and gold male. Weapon choice: ridiculous range of bombs including candy bombs, stink bombs, and antimatter. Has been known to mix these up...

Kazia changed herself to allow partnering with Sterling Superyacht and had two more children. These are a few months old and are winged like Mommy is.

- **Jasmine** - outgoing, grabby, cuddling pretty forty-foot cygnet.
- **William** - same size as his sister, deeply shy and quiet at the moment. He may be autistic, though getting a real diagnosis might be tricky.
- **Freyja** - daughter of Loria and Yokazuma, an aircraft carrier from another world. She's a trimaran LCS-2 stealth battleship, winged and modified as she wanted. Trigger-happy... Be warned.

## Arizona Skyline

Arizona is a hybrid headmate who came by way of a real-life Skyline and a character from one of my stories. In that story, she's the avatar of a death spirit Goddess looking for companionship and took the form of a car.  

The real-life car was a drift car I fell for but couldn't buy. This resulted in a strange character whose introduction to our server was a rather odd obsession with quills—found on the phallus of Amrian and some other mech species.  

She has two children, one by a Greater Amrian known as Amari and the other by another Skyline who still dates her now.  

She's a Divinity, the Goddess of Life, and a tech mage, and so are her cubs.

- **Arizona** - Mother to:
  - **Ronin** - R34 cub, male winged tech mage.
  - **Danae** - R34 cub, female winged tech mage.
  - **Viawa** - Apache cub with OP mage powers.
- **Kai** - Cybercity Quadra RS-V who is not meant to be a tulpa but is. He's 18 and likes playing with the cygnets.

## My Own Alter Egos

### Seafire Superyacht

- **Role**: Daddy Superyacht, partner to Aurora and Scarlet Lamborghini (*Yeah, he cheated to make the latter work!*)  
- **Traits**: 180m Superyacht, oversized Mauna Kea with jet pods, wings (2 pairs), 4 major limbs folded away, minor dendrites. Due to ridiculous trait inheritance (Aktarian and Divine), is silly OP and doesn't take part in combat as he's a family man.

### SoulWolf

- **Description**: Oversized winged wolf with a jet cub in another host's headspace.
- **Traits**: Magic and Aktarian nonsense.

### Xan - Carsona Zenvo

- **Description**: Randomly acquired alter ego—as I never had a carsona. It was a choice between this and a Quadra until Kai came along.
- **Traits**: Mostly just a car... with wings. But I cheat, a lot.

*Edit to reset timer. As I get older, my headmates seem more natural, though quieter.*
