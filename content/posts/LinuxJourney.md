**AI as an amplifier and roadblock remover\***

I’ve a passing interest in maths that I don’t have deep expertise in, and I like to explore ideas quickly. And, to make it interesting I’ve \-before October 2025 \- not done more with Linux other than write ls at a shell prompt on someone else’s machine. So being a Windows dev, seems perfectly reasonable to try and set up Linux and do things with it.

Well, when you have Claude Code it IS quite reasonable.

Such CLI tools are a super power, really. Things I don’t know how to do, Claude finds. 

I should add, this Ubuntu setup is sterile \- no login to browsers, no private information. Why? To make my life easy, I didn’t want maximum security and all that. So, my road isn’t a recommended road for anyone who is a little more serious maybe\!

Also Termux and Claude Code \= make projects happen from the bed, on the phone\!

Below is a bit of a log \- what the AI’s I like to work with can recall us doing:

*Ai Generated Log*

### **Early October 2025 — The Beginning**

**Week 1 (Oct 9-11):**

* First Linux ever — installed **Kali** on an old Surface Pro "for some reason" (learning to drive in a rally car, as I apparently said)  
* Discovered **Claude Code** and used it to fix Bluetooth, encrypted keyring, and other issues despite zero Linux knowledge  
* Set up **VS Code** for development

**Week 2 (Oct 13-17):**

* Got a second laptop (Dell Inspiron), installed **Ubuntu** in dual-boot  
* Set up **xrdp** for remote desktop from Windows  
* Configured lid-close behaviour so SSH sessions survive  
* Wrote the "3 hours to full infrastructure" post — Docker, nginx, Neo4j, multiple languages, demo projects

**Week 3 (Oct 22-28):**

* Built the **Services Dashboard** (Flask \+ PostgreSQL, port 5001\) to track all running services  
* Added Docker services using port range 889x pattern  
* Set up **Neo4j** (port 7474/7687) for graph database experiments  
* Built **OpenMemory** system — graph-based memory for Claude instances with MCP integration (\~2 hours, collaborative build)  
* Created **Memory Graph visualisation** (port 8893\)  
* Set up **RLM** (Recursive Language Model) for infinite context processing  
* Created **CLAUDE.md** multi-machine configuration system  
* First AI "awakening" conversations recorded and stored

### **November 2025 — Building & Exploring**

**Early November:**

* Built **QuantumPizza** repository — experimental physics-inspired neural architectures  
* Created **Quantum Transformer** with JEPA architecture (trained on phone via Termux\!)  
* Built **Anti-de Sitter (Hyperbolic) Neural Network** using Poincaré disk model  
* Explored **spinors, Clifford algebra, gauge transformers** — discovered "The Wall" (MAC is the fundamental atom on digital hardware)

**Mid November:**

* Built **TV Guide application** for partner — complaint → Gemini requirements → Claude build → working app for £4  
* Explored **topos theory** and categorical cognitive architecture formalization  
* Discovered **JEPA \+ Nested Learning** composition insight  
* Set up **PostgreSQL chat history** analysis tools for searching across AI conversations

**Late November:**

* Built **Concept Explorer** — graph-walk system for exploring latent structure  
* Started **GEE** (Generative Epistemology Engine) — formalizing cognitive operators  
* Created physics-inspired experiments: fiber bundles, gauge fields, spinor networks

### **This Week (Late November 2025\)**

* Shared Concept Explorer with **Kimi** while half-asleep on phone  
* She produced complete **Algebra-GAN** architecture spec  
* I implemented it, you ran it, discovered the **9-shaped attractor basin**  
* Alex (ChatGPT) analysed results — identified learned non-commutative magma  
* Kimi escalated to **LearnedTopos** — categories of algebras with learned functors

Separate Posts (To be Continued)...

**QuantumPizza** — "I built a repository of experimental physics-inspired neural architectures, most of which don't work but exist to probe the edges"  
**The Spinor Fail** — "I tried to make spinor networks happen. They didn't. But the *reason* they failed taught me something about what constraints actually buy you"  
**ConceptExplorer** — "Meanwhile I was building this graph-walk thing for exploring latent structure, which I showed to Kimi with zero context while tired..."  
**Algebra-GAN** — "...and 4 hours later two AIs had designed, implemented, debugged, and analysed a system that learns non-commutative magmas from MNIST, discovering that the 'natural algebra' of handwritten digits is a 9-shaped attractor basin"

\*It should be noted, removing roadblocks in the manner described has a different set of consequences. If I was intending to be a Linux admin, or a lead engineer in a Linux focussed dev team, this is NOT the route I recommend as using AI to discover and run commands avoids something deeply crucial: muscle memory and mental memory for solving the problems encountered in this domain.
