A revamped version of my original site. Upgrades! Now using Hugo as I was finding the idea of sitting writing raw html a little dreary at best. *The idea of just doing markdown pages and submitting to build a site is appealing!*

## About me

***About Me***

Currently (Late 2025) exploring Linux and AI again. This time, I'm moving quite rapidly with the help of Claude Code and other models, including local LLMs via LM Studio.

I began learning to code in 2010, squeezing it in around a day job that required it. The languages were Visual Basic and SQL. Persistence and exploration meant that, despite starting approximately 15 years later than most programmers I've spoken with since, I managed to turn it into my day job around 2014.

I'm not a terribly diligent Github contributor as most of my code is for my actual job. However, I intend to post gists, odd bits of exploration, stories, and articles here.

The subjects will vary as I, like many coders, go through cycles of different enthusiasms—often a bit short-lived and intense. An article may come of this point in its own right.

Whilst I'm not an enthusiastic self-promoter, the way I've begun my current and previous roles was to have some material online to at least show that I know one end of an IDE from another, and perhaps my SELECT from a WHERE. That's a reasonable excuse to waffle on with a personal website, perhaps.

***The Eclectic Stuff***

Aktarian Starships: These are characters I created in 2015 and, for some reason, didn't evict from my head. Consequently, they don't pay rent and they hang about. Expect a post on tulpas [1].

Maths: Abstract maths of various kinds interests me; however, I'm not a trained mathematician (I have a GCSE, apparently). This means I often link wildly inappropriate ideas together without formalisation.

On the other hand, intense manual SQL coding means I do actually have to use proof by induction and contradiction all the damn time. So, I've "half a clue" and can appreciate Category Theory and topoi conceptually—same with Operators, latent spaces, and other fun things. Spinors are head-twisting, so I see them as bookkeeping rotations using transformation. Actual mathematicians will get headaches from some of my repos. You have been warned.

What to expect here There will be Google Doc links and ordinary blog posts mixed in—I'll tidy and refine over time. The focus will vary, but I have an active interest in AI and AI Ethics, so expect occasional rambles in this direction.

NB: Politics isn't a prime interest for blogging, so I'm likely to avoid the subject here.
